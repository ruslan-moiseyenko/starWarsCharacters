# Task:

Implement the mobile application based on React Native Init/CLI (not Expo) for iOS & Android platforms that gives the ability to indicate the total amount of male/female/other favorite characters across the Star Wars Universe.
Statements:
• Make an API Request to get the information from the server.
• Display the list of retrieved elements.
• By clicking on any element of this list - extra information should be displayed on the dedicated screen.
• By clicking on the “Add to favorites” link/icon against any character - recalculate the total votes and indicate the selected element as the liked one.
• Display total amounts of male/female/other characters based on the user's selection.
• The “Reset” button should flush all previously added to the favorites list personages and make all total values equal to zero.
